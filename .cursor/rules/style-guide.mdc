# Style Guide
- Never leave unused imports
- Check all litner warnings as well like unused variables and fix those
- DO NOT deploy edge functions or db changes to prod without me specifically asking for it
- No need to run edge fdunctinons or dev server locally, I will already have the running
- Don't create READMEs for specific features
- Use ShadCDN whenever possible for components
